    <h2><u>Short Introduction:</u></h2>
    <p>
       <s>I have a curse</s>
       <br>I have a gift

       <br><br><s>I am a monster</s>
       <br>I'm more than human
       
       <br><br><s>My touch is lethal</s>
       <br>My touch is power
       
       <br><br><s>I am their weapon</s>
       <br>I will fight back
       
       <br><br>Juliette hasn't touched anyone in exactly 264 days.
       <br><br>The last time she did, it was an accident, but The Reestablishment locked her up for murder. No one knows why Juliette's touch is fatal. As long as she doesn't hurt anyone else, no one really cares. The world is too busy crumbling to pieces to pay attention to a 17-year-old girl. Diseases are destroying the population, food is hard to find, birds don't fly anymore, and the clouds are the wrong color.
       <br><br>The Reestablishment said their way was the only way to fix things, so they threw Juliette in a cell. Now so many people are dead that the survivors are whispering war—and The Reestablishment has changed its mind. Maybe Juliette is more than a tortured soul stuffed into a poisonous body. Maybe she's exactly what they need right now.
       <br><br>Juliette has to make a choice: Be a weapon. Or be a warrior.

    <p>
        “I'm oxygen and he's dying to breathe.”
        <br><b>― Tahereh Mafi, Shatter Me</b>

        <br><br><br>“The moon is a loyal companion.
        <br>It never leaves. It's always there, watching, steadfast, knowing us in our light and dark moments, changing forever just as we do. Every day it’s a different version of itself. Sometimes weak and wan, sometimes strong and full of light. The moon understands what it means to be human.
        <br>Uncertain. Alone. Cratered by imperfections.”
        <br><b>― Tahereh Mafi, Shatter Me</b>        

        <br><br><br>“Books are easily destroyed. But words will live as long as people can remember them.”
        <br><b>― Tahereh Mafi, Unravel Me</b>
        
        <br><br><br>“Why do you call her 'love'?" James asks. "I've heard you say that before, too. A lot. Are you in love with her? I think Adam's in love with her. Kenji's not in love with her, though. I already asked him."
        <br>Warner blinks at him.
        <br>"Well?" James asks.
        <br>"Well what?"
        <br>"Are you in love with her?"
        <br>"Are <i>you</i> in love with her?"
        <br>"What?" James blushes. "No. She's like a million years older than me."
        <br>"Would anyone else like to take over this conversation?" Warner asks, looking around the group.”
        <br><b>― Tahereh Mafi, Ignite Me</b>
