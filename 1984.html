        “Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it.”
        <br><b>― George Orwell, 1984</b>

        <br><br><br>“If you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones.”
        <br><b>― George Orwell, 1984</b>

        <br><br><br>“Winston Smith: Does Big Brother exist?
        <br>O'Brien: Of course he exists.
        <br>Winston Smith: Does he exist like you or me?
        <br>O'Brien: You do not exist.”
        <br><b>― George Orwell, 1984</b>

        <br><br><br>“War is peace.
        <br>Freedom is slavery.
        <br>Ignorance is strength.”
        <br><b>― George Orwell, 1984</b>

        <br><br><br>“Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.”
        <br><b>― George Orwell, 1984</b>

        <br><br><br>“We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.”
