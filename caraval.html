    <h2><u>Short Introduction:</u></h2>
    <p>Scarlett Dragna has never left the tiny island where she and her sister, Tella, live with their powerful, and cruel, father. Now Scarlett's father has arranged a marriage for her, and Scarlett thinks her dreams of seeing Caraval—the faraway, once-a-year performance where the audience participates in the show—are over.
        <br><br>But this year, Scarlett's long-dreamt-of invitation finally arrives. With the help of a mysterious sailor, Tella whisks Scarlett away to the show. Only, as soon as they arrive, Tella is kidnapped by Caraval's mastermind organizer, Legend. It turns out that this season's Caraval revolves around Tella, and whoever finds her first is the winner.
        <br><br>Scarlett has been told that everything that happens during Caraval is only an elaborate performance. Nevertheless she becomes enmeshed in a game of love, heartbreak, and magic. And whether Caraval is real or not, Scarlett must find Tella before the five nights of the game are over or a dangerous domino effect of consequences will be set off, and her beloved sister will disappear forever.
        <br><br>Welcome, welcome to Caraval . . . beware of getting swept too far away.

    <p>
        “Every person has the power to change their fate if they are brave enough to fight for what they desire more than anything.”
        <br><b>― Stephanie Garber, Caraval</b>

        <br><br><br>“Dreams that come true can be beautiful, but they can also turn into nightmares when people won't wake up.”
        <br><b>― Stephanie Garber, Caraval</b>

        <br><br><br>“No one is truly honest,” Nigel answered. “Even if we don't lie to others, we often lie to ourselves. And the word good means different things to different people.”

        <br><br><br>“Occasionally, there are minutes that get extra seconds. Moments so precious the universe stretches to make additional room for them.”
