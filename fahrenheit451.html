    <h2><u>Short Introduction:</u></h2>
    <p>
        Nearly seventy years after its original publication, Ray Bradbury's internationally acclaimed novel Fahrenheit 451 stands as a classic of world literature set in a bleak, dystopian future. Today its message has grown more relevant than ever before.
        <br><br>Guy Montag is a fireman. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television “family.” But when he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn’t live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known.

    <p>
        “If you hide your ignorance, no one will hit you and you'll never learn.”
        <br><b>― Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451</b>

        <br><br><br>“With school turning out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers, grabbers, snatchers, fliers, and swimmers instead of examiners, critics, knowers, and imaginative creators, the word 'intellectual,' of course, became the swear word it deserved to be.”
        <br><b>― Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451</b>

        <br><br><br>“The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.”
        <br><b>― Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451</b>

        <br><br><br>“I'm seventeen and I'm crazy. My uncle says the two always go together. When people ask your age, he said, always say seventeen and insane.”
        <br><b>― Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451</b>
